# Writeups for the nahamcon 2024 CTF

My intention with these writeups is not to do as many as possible, but to really walk you through my thought process
as I worked on them. I've only been doing CTFs for a little over a year, and I am still learning and developing my
intuition for solving various types of challenges. So they're more than a little wordy, but I wanted my explanations
to be a little more useful than a lot of writeups I see that just say things like "so I played with it for a bit and
got the flag!"

Everyone's a beginner at some point, and I hope my writeups will help another beginner learn something.
